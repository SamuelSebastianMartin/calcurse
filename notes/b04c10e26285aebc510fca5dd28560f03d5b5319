Dear All

As this is David last meeting, this will be an ALL Foundation College Staff Meeting – cake to be provided by him

This will be on Campus in Room B203 and will not Hybrid/on Teams

David has also asked me to Invite Ilana

Please can people indicate they will be attending by accepting this Calendar invite, as the last meeting it wasn’t clear before the meeting started

Thanks

Matt
