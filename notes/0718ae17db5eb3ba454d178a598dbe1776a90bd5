Branch meeting, Tuesday 11 April We will have a branch meeting on Tuesday 11 April at 12.00. This is going to be quite important, strategically at both the national and SOAS levels: - We will know the result of the reballotsâ€”hopefully by Monday 3 April; - We will have information about motions that have been submitted to the special HE sector conference on 19 April, and will be able to consider submitting amendments: this conference will very much set the direction for the future of the disputes; - We will also have a variety of local issues to update on and consider next steps in. Full agenda to follow nearer the time.
